# Q1: What is the main difference between Generative AI (GAI) and Traditional AI?
Generative AI (GAI):
-Purpose: GAI is designed to create new content or generate data that mimics real-world inputs. It can produce text, images, audio, video, or even code, based on the patterns and structures it has learned from large datasets.
-Example: GPT models (like this one), DALLÂ·E (for image generation), and music generation AI. They are capable of creating novel outputs based on training data but are not limited to simply classifying or recognizing existing data.

Traditional AI:
-Purpose: Traditional AI focuses on analyzing and processing existing data to perform tasks such as classification, prediction, optimization, and decision-making. It uses predefined algorithms for specific tasks.
-Example: Machine learning models for spam detection, recommendation systems, or fraud detection, which work with existing data to make predictions or solve specific problems.
